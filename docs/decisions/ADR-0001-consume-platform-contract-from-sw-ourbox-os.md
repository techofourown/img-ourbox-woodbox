# ADR-0001: Consume the OurBox OS Platform Contract from `sw-ourbox-os`

## Status
Proposed

## Context

This repository (`img-ourbox-woodbox`) produces a **custom Ubuntu Server installer ISO** for the
Woodbox hardware (x86-64, NVMe OS disk + any-transport DATA disk). It is responsible for:

- bootability + base OS configuration (via autoinstall ISO)
- disk/storage contract enforcement (operator-selected OS + DATA disks)
- first-boot bootstrap services (k3s bring-up, applying baseline manifests, etc.)
- airgap/offline friendliness

Historically, image repos often become the accidental "home" of the platform baseline (the manifests
and components that make the box feel like an appliance). That creates drift and makes it easy for
the platform baseline to change without a clear upstream provenance boundary.

At the org level, TOOO adopted OCI artifacts + digests as the canonical distribution substrate for
apps and platform components (org ADR-0007). In `sw-ourbox-os`, we allocated that posture into an
explicit **platform contract artifact** concept (ADR-0009 + integration doc).

This image repo must align with that model:

> `sw-ourbox-os` defines the platform contract. Image repos consume it.

This preserves "one lane, explicit trust" while keeping the official baseline legible and hard to
quietly alter.

## Decision

### 1) Source of truth

The OurBox OS **platform contract** consumed by Woodbox images SHALL be sourced from
`sw-ourbox-os`, not defined ad-hoc in this repo.

Canonical upstream docs:
- `sw-ourbox-os` ADR-0009 (platform contract as OCI artifact)
- `sw-ourbox-os` artifact distribution + integration reference

### 2) Phase 0 allowance (vendored baseline is permitted, but must be traceable)

Until the platform contract is packaged and consumed as an OCI artifact by digest, this repo MAY
vendor a copy of the baseline manifests (e.g., as part of the airgap platform content staged at
`installer/ourbox/rootfs/opt/ourbox/airgap/platform/`).

However:
- Vendored baseline content MUST be traceable to a specific `sw-ourbox-os` revision (and ideally a version).
- Baseline changes MUST be treated as upstream contract updates, not "random tweaks in the image repo."

### 3) Provenance is mandatory

The installed system MUST record platform contract provenance in `/etc/ourbox/release` so operators
can answer "what platform baseline is running?" locally.

Required keys (Phase 0+):
- `OURBOX_PLATFORM_CONTRACT_SOURCE` (repo URL or canonical identity)
- `OURBOX_PLATFORM_CONTRACT_REVISION` (git SHA of `sw-ourbox-os`)

Optional keys (when available):
- `OURBOX_PLATFORM_CONTRACT_VERSION` (e.g., `v0.8.0`)
- `OURBOX_PLATFORM_CONTRACT_DIGEST` (OCI digest, `sha256:...`)

### 4) Future intent

When `sw-ourbox-os` publishes the platform contract as an OCI artifact, this repo SHOULD move to
consuming it by digest (build-time embed or first-boot fetch), per the upstream plan.

## Rationale

- Keeps the platform baseline "officialness" anchored in one producer repo.
- Prevents silent baseline drift across multiple image repos.
- Makes support and debugging possible: "show me the platform contract revision/digest."
- Preserves hackability: users can replace the contract, but the provenance boundary stays legible.

## Consequences

### Positive
- Clear producer/consumer boundary: `sw-ourbox-os` produces the contract, image repos consume it.
- Image repos become more mechanical: hardware enablement + bootstrap, not "platform policy."
- Helps later trust hardening (signatures / release manifests) land cleanly.

### Negative
- Requires discipline when vendoring baseline content during Phase 0.
- Adds additional release metadata fields to maintain.

### Mitigation
- Add a dedicated reference doc describing the Phase 0 vendoring workflow and future OCI-by-digest
  consumption (`docs/reference/platform-contract.md`).
- Keep the required provenance keys small and stable.
